# [`transfer()` is not recommended for sending ETH](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-nftx-findings/issues/94)

# Vulnerability details

Since the introduction of `transfer()`, it has typically been recommended by the security community because it helps guard against reentrancy attacks. This guidance made sense under the assumption that gas costs wouldnâ€™t change. It's now recommended that transfer() and send() be avoided, as gas costs can and will change and reentrancy guard is more commonly used.

Any smart contract that uses `transfer()` is taking a hard dependency on gas costs by forwarding a fixed amount of gas: 2300.

It's recommended to stop using `transfer()` and switch to using `call()` instead.

```solidity
payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
```

Can be changed to:

```solidity
(bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
require(success, "ETH transfer failed");
```
