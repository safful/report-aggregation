# [Centralisation RIsk: Owner Of `RoyaltyVault` Can Take All Funds](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-joyn-findings/issues/9)

# Vulnerability details

## Impact

The owner of `RoyaltyVault` can set `_platformFee` to any arbitrary value (e.g. 100% = 10000) and that share of the contracts balance and future balances will be set to the `platformFeeRecipient` (which is in the owners control) rather than the splitter contract.

As a result the owner can steal the entire contract balance and any future balances avoiding the splitter.

## Proof of Concept

```
    function setPlatformFee(uint256 _platformFee) external override onlyOwner {
        platformFee = _platformFee;
        emit NewRoyaltyVaultPlatformFee(_platformFee);
    }
```

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

This issue may be mitigated by add a maximum value for the `_platformFee` say 5% (or some reasonable value based on the needs of the platform).

Also consider calling `sendToSplitter()` before adjusting the `platformFee`. This will only allow the owner to change the fee for future value excluding the current contract balance.

Consider the following code.
```
    function setPlatformFee(uint256 _platformFee) external override onlyOwner {
        require(_platformFee < MAX_FEE);
        sendToSplitter(); // @audit this will need to be public rather than external
        platformFee = _platformFee;
        emit NewRoyaltyVaultPlatformFee(_platformFee);
    }
```
