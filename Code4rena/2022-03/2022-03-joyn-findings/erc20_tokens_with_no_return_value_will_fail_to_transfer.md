# Vulnerability details

 Although the ERC20 standard suggests that a transfer should return true on success, many tokens are non-compliant in this regard (including high profile, like USDT) . In that case, the .transfer() call here will revert even if the transfer is successful, because solidity will check that the RETURNDATASIZE matches the ERC20 interface.

Recommendation: Consider using OpenZeppelinâ€™s SafeERC20
