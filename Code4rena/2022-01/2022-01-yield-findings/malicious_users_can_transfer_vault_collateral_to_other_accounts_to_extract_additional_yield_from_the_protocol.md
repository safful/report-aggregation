# [Malicious Users Can Transfer Vault Collateral To Other Accounts To Extract Additional Yield From The Protocol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-yield-findings/issues/89)

# Vulnerability details

## Impact

`ConvexYieldWrapper.sol` is a wrapper contract for staking convex tokens on the user's behalf, allowing them to earn rewards on their deposit. Users will interact with the `Ladle.sol` contract's `batch()` function which:
- Approves Ladle to move the tokens.
- Transfers the tokens to `ConvexYieldWrapper.sol`.
- Wraps/stakes these tokens.
- Updates accounting and produces debt tokens within `Ladle.sol`.

`_getDepositedBalance()` takes into consideration the user's total collateral stored in all of their owned vaults. However, as a vault owner, you are allowed to give the vault to another user, move collateral between vaults and add/remove collateral. Therefore, it is possible to manipulate the result of this function by checkpointing one user's balance at a given time, transferring ownership to another user and then create a new checkpoint with this user. 

As a result, a user is able to generate protocol yield multiple times over on a single collateral amount. This can be abused to effectively extract all protocol yield.

## Proof of Concept

Consider the following exploit scenario:
- Alice owns a vault which has 100 tokens worth of collateral.
- At that point in time, `_getDepositedBalance()` returns 100 as its result. A checkpoint has also been made on this balance, giving Alice claim to her fair share of the rewards.
- Alice then calls `Ladle.give()`, transferring the ownership of the vault to Bob and calls `ConvexYieldWrapper.addVault()`.
- Bob is able to call `user_checkpoint()` and effectively update their checkpointed balance.
- At this point in time, both Alice and Bob have claim to any yield generated by the protocol, however, there is only one vault instance that holds the underlying collateral.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-yield/blob/main/contracts/ConvexYieldWrapper.sol#L100-L120
```
function _getDepositedBalance(address account_) internal view override returns (uint256) {
    if (account_ == address(0) || account_ == collateralVault) {
        return 0;
    }

    bytes12[] memory userVault = vaults[account_];

    //add up all balances of all vaults registered in the wrapper and owned by the account
    uint256 collateral;
    DataTypes.Balances memory balance;
    uint256 userVaultLength = userVault.length;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < userVaultLength; i++) {
        if (cauldron.vaults(userVault[i]).owner == account_) {
            balance = cauldron.balances(userVault[i]);
            collateral = collateral + balance.ink;
        }
    }

    //add to balance of this token
    return _balanceOf[account_] + collateral;
}
```

## Tools Used

Manual code review.
Discussion/confirmation with the Yield Protocol team.

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

Ensure that any change to a vault will correctly checkpoint the previous and new vault owner. The affected actions include but are not limited to; transferring ownership of a vault to a new account, transferring collateral to another vault and adding/removing collateral to/from a vault.
