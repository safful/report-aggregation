# [Malicious Users Can Duplicate Protocol Earned Yield By Transferring `wCVX` Tokens To Another Account](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-yield-findings/issues/86)

# Vulnerability details

## Impact

`ConvexYieldWrapper.sol` is a wrapper contract for staking convex tokens on the user's behalf, allowing them to earn rewards on their deposit. Users will interact with the `Ladle.sol` contract's `batch()` function which:
- Approves Ladle to move the tokens.
- Transfers the tokens to `ConvexYieldWrapper.sol`.
- Wraps/stakes these tokens.
- Updates accounting and produces debt tokens within `Ladle.sol`.

During `wrap()` and `unwrap()` actions, `_checkpoint()` is used to update the rewards for the `from_` and `to_` accounts. However, the [reference](https://github.com/convex-eth/platform/blob/main/contracts/contracts/wrappers/ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L395-L397) contract implements a `_beforeTokenTransfer()` function which has been removed from Yield Protocol's custom implementation.

As a result, it is possible to transfer `wCVX` tokens to another account after an initial checkpoint has been made. By manually calling `user_checkpoint()` on the new account, this user is able to update its deposited balance of the new account while the sender's balance is not updated. This can be repeated to effectively replicate a user's deposited balance over any number of accounts. To claim yield generated by the protocol, the user must only make sure that the account calling `getReward()` holds the tokens for the duration of the call.

## Proof of Concept

The exploit can be outlined through the following steps:
- Alice receives 100 `wCVX` tokens from the protocol after wrapping their convex tokens.
- At that point in time, `_getDepositedBalance()` returns 100 as its result. A checkpoint has also been made on this balance, giving Alice claim to her fair share of the rewards.
- Alice transfers her tokens to her friend Bob who then manually calls `user_checkpoint()` to update his balance.
- Now from the perspective of the protocol, both Alice and Bob have 100 `wCVX` tokens as calculated by the `_getDepositedBalance()` function.
- If either Alice or Bob wants to claim rewards, all they need to do is make sure the 100 `wCVX` tokens are in their account upon calling `getReward()`. Afterwards, the tokens can be transferred out.

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider implementing the `_beforeTokenTransfer()` function as shown in the [reference](https://github.com/convex-eth/platform/blob/main/contracts/contracts/wrappers/ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L395-L397) contract. However, it is important to ensure the wrapper contract and collateral vaults are excluded from the checkpointing so they are not considered in the rewards calculations.
