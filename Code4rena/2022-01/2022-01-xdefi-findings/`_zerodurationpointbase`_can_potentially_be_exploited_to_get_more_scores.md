# Vulnerability details

`_zeroDurationPointBase` can be set at deploy time so that locks with 0 duration can get scores.

However, if the value of `_zeroDurationPointBase` is being set high enough. It can potentially be exploited by repeatedly lock(), and unlock() with 0 duration to get scores.

This can get amplified with flashloans.

```solidity
function _getPoints(uint256 amount_, uint256 duration_) internal view returns (uint256 points_) {
    return amount_ * (duration_ + _zeroDurationPointBase);
}
```

## Recommendation

Consider changing `_zeroDurationPointBase` to a constant of value `1`.
