# [Mint library uses wrong error code for max collateral check](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-timeswap-findings/issues/56)

# Vulnerability details

## Impact

There can be issues with troubleshooting and system usage analytics.

## Proof of Concept

E512 error code is meant for 'Debt is greater than max Debt' situation:

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-timeswap/blob/main/Timeswap/Timeswap-V1-Convenience/ErrorCodes.md#e512


In Mint library E512 is used for collateral max value check:

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-timeswap/blob/main/Timeswap/Timeswap-V1-Convenience/contracts/libraries/Mint.sol#L482


Also, code E513, that is to be used for collateral check above, is also used for max asset increase check, which doesnâ€™t seem to have an error code of its own:

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-timeswap/blob/main/Timeswap/Timeswap-V1-Convenience/contracts/libraries/Mint.sol#L481

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-timeswap/blob/main/Timeswap/Timeswap-V1-Convenience/contracts/libraries/Mint.sol#L643


## Recommended Mitigation Steps

Change Mint line 482 error code to be 513:
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-timeswap/blob/main/Timeswap/Timeswap-V1-Convenience/ErrorCodes.md#e513

Possibly add an error code for max asset check for Mint lines 481 and 643.
