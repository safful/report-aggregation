# [Useless storage variable](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-trader-joe-findings/issues/116) 

# Handle

# Vulnerability details

## Impact

`pendingRJoe()` reads a user into a storage variable, which is redundant since itâ€™s a `view()` function and the variable is never modified in place. It can be replaced by a `memory` variable for readability

## Proof of Concept
