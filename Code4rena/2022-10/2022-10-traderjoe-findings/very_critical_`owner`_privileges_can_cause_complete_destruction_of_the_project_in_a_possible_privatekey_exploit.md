# [Very critical `Owner` privileges can cause complete destruction of the project in a possible privateKey exploit](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-traderjoe-findings/issues/139)

# Vulnerability details

### Vulnerability details
Typically, the contract’s owner is the account that deploys the contract. As a result, the owner is able to perform certain privileged activities.

However, Owner privileges are numerous and there is no timelock structure in the process of using these privileges.
The Owner is assumed to be an EOA, since the documents do not provide information on whether the Owner will be a multisign structure.

In parallel with the private key thefts of the project owners, which have increased recently, this vulnerability has been stated as medium.

### Proof of Concept

`onlyOwner` powers;
```js
14 results - 2 files

src/LBFactory.sol:
  220:     function setLBPairImplementation(address _LBPairImplementation) external override onlyOwner {
  322:     function setLBPairIgnored() external override onlyOwner {
  355:     function setPreset() external override onlyOwner {
  401:     function removePreset(uint16 _binStep) external override onlyOwner {
  439:     function setFeesParametersOnPair) external override onlyOwner {
  473:     function setFeeRecipient(address _feeRecipient) external override onlyOwner {
  479:     function setFlashLoanFee(uint256 _flashLoanFee) external override onlyOwner {
  490:     function setFactoryLockedState(bool _locked) external override onlyOwner {
  498:     function addQuoteAsset(IERC20 _quoteAsset) external override onlyOwner {
  507:     function removeQuoteAsset(IERC20 _quoteAsset) external override onlyOwner {
  525:     function forceDecay(ILBPair _LBPair) external override onlyOwner {

src/libraries/PendingOwnable.sol:
  59:     function setPendingOwner(address pendingOwner_) public override onlyOwner {
  68:     function revokePendingOwner() public override onlyOwner {
  84:     function renounceOwnership() public override onlyOwner {



```

### Recommendation;

1- A timelock contract should be added to use `onlyOwner` privileges. In this way, users can be warned in case of a possible security weakness.
2- `onlyOwner` can be a Multisign wallet and this part is specified in the documentation
