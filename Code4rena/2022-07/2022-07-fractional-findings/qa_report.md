# summary

> Few vulnerabilities were found examining the contracts. The main concerns are with:

# Low issues

# hash collision with abi.encodePacked

## IMPACT

strings and bytes are encoded with padding when using `abi.encodePacked`. This can lead to [hash collision](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.15/abi-spec.html#non-standard-packed-mode) when passing the result to `keccak256`

## SEVERITY

Low

## PROOF OF CONCEPT

Instances include:

### src/FERC1155.sol


```cpp
394:             keccak256(
395:                 abi.encodePacked("\x19\x01", _domainSeparator, _structHash)
396:             );
```


## TOOLS USED

Manual Analysis

## MITIGATION

Use `abi.encode()` instead.


# Native `transfer` should be avoided

## IMPACT


In `Migration`, the `.transfer()` method is used to transfer ETH. 

The `transfer()` call requires that the recipient has a payable callback, only provides 2300 gas for its operation. This means the following cases can cause the transfer to fail:

- The contract does not have a payable callback
- The contractâ€™s payable callback spends more than 2300 gas (which is only enough to emit something)
- The contract is called through a proxy which itself uses up the 2300 gas

## SEVERITY

Low

## PROOF OF CONCEPT

Instances include:

### src/modules/Migration.sol

```cpp
172:         payable(msg.sender).transfer(ethAmount);
325:         payable(msg.sender).transfer(ethAmount);
```


## TOOLS USED

Manual Analysis

## MITIGATION

Use `.call()` to send ETH instead.

# Return value of ERC20.transferFrom unchecked

## IMPACT


Some ERC20 implementations do not revert upon a fail `transfer/transferFrom` call, but return `false` instead. Not checking the return values of these calls can hence lead to silent failures of tokens transfers.

## SEVERITY

Low

## PROOF OF CONCEPT

Instances include:

### src/modules/protoforms/BaseVault.sol

```cpp
65:             IERC20(_tokens[i]).transferFrom(_from, _to, _amounts[i]);
```


## TOOLS USED

Manual Analysis

## MITIGATION

Check the return value of these calls to ensure they are not `0`

# Setters and constructors should check the input value

## PROBLEM

Setters and constructors should check the input value for addresses - ie revert if `address(0)` is assigned to `address` variables.



## SEVERITY

Low

## MITIGATION

Add non-zero checks


# Unused `receive()` functions

## IMPACT


`Vault` and `Buyout` have an empty `receive()` function, but do not have any withdrawal function. Any ETH mistakenly sent to these contracts with empty `msg.data` would be locked.

# Non-critical issues

# Constants instead of magic numbers

## PROBLEM

It is best practice to use constant variables rather than literal values (100, 1000, etc) to make the code easier to understand and maintain.

## TOOLS USED

## MITIGATION

Define constant variables for the literal values aforementioned.


# Events indexing

## PROBLEM

Events should use the maximum amount of indexed fields: up to three parameters. This makes it easier to filter for specific values in front-ends.

# Event should be emitted in setters

## PROBLEM

Setters should emit an event so that Dapps can detect important changes to storage

# Public functions can be external

It is good practice to mark functions as `external` instead of `public` if they are not called by the contract where they are defined.

# Redundant cast

## PROBLEM

In `Migration.commit()`, `buyout` is cast to type `address`, which is redundant as it is already of type `address`.

# Scientific notation

## PROBLEM

For readability, it is best to use scientific notation (e.g `10e5`) rather than decimal literals(`100000`) or exponentiation(`10**5`)

## SEVERITY

Instances include:

### src/modules/Buyout.sol

## TOOLS USED

Manual Analysis

## MITIGATION

Replace `1000` with `10e3`

# Signature malleability

## PROBLEM

`permit` and `permitAll` in `FERC1155` use Solidity's `ecrecover` to verify signatures. The EVM opcode associated with this function allows for malleable signatures and thus is susceptible to replay attacks. There is no direct threat to the protocol - these functions only approve operators - but it is still a good practice to avoid signature malleability.
