# [ Someone can create non-liquidatable auction if the collateral asset fails on transferring to address(0)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-yield-findings/issues/116)

# Vulnerability details

## Impact
might lead to systematic debt. Cause errors for liquidators to run normally.

## Proof of Concept
In the function `auction`, there is on input validation around whether the `to` is `address(0)` or not. and if the `auctioneerReward` is set to an value > 0 (as default),  each liquidate call will call `Join` module to pay out to `auctioneer` with the following line:

```jsx
if (auctioneerCut > 0) {
    ilkJoin.exit(auction_.auctioneer, auctioneerCut.u128());
}
```

This line will revert if `auctioneer` is set to `address(0)` on some tokens (revert on transferring to address(0) is a [default behaviour of the OpenZeppelin template](https://www.notion.so/Yield-Witch-555e6981c26b41008d03a504077b4770)). So if someone start an `auction` with `to = address(0)`, this auction becomes un-liquidatable.

A malicious user can run a bot to monitor his own vault, and if the got underwater and they donâ€™t have enough collateral to top up, they can immediately start an auction on their own vault and set actioneer to `0` to avoid actually being liquidated, which breaks the design of the system.


## Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add check while starting an auction:

```jsx
function auction(bytes12 vaultId, address to)
    external
    returns (DataTypes.Auction memory auction_)
{
    require (to != address(0), "invalid auctioneer");
		...
}		
```
