# Vulnerability details

## Description

`MarketPlace.createMarket()` calls `Creator.create()` which creates an instance of `ZcToken` and a `VaultTracker`. `VaultTracker` takes `msg.sender` as the admin. We know that if contract A calls contract B which calls contract C, `msg.sender` in contract C is the address of B i.e. the `msg.sender` in VaultTracker is the address of the creator contract. However, the creator contract is not able (and not supposed to) interact with the VaultTracker unlike the marketplace contract.

## Tools used
Manual analysis

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

Modify the constructor of the VaultTracker contract so that the creator contract can pass in msg.sender (MarketPlaceâ€™s address) to be used as admin.
