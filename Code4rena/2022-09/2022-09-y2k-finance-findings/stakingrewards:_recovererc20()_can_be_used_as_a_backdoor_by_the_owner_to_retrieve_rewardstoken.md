# Vulnerability details

## Impact
Similar to https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur-findings/issues/210
StakingRewards.recoverERC20 rightfully checks against the stakingToken being sweeped away.
However, thereâ€™s no check against the rewardsToken.
This is the case of an admin privilege, which allows the owner to sweep the rewards tokens, perhaps as a way to rug depositors.
```
    function recoverERC20(address tokenAddress, uint256 tokenAmount)
        external
        onlyOwner
    {
        require(
            tokenAddress != address(stakingToken),
            "Cannot withdraw the staking token"
        );
        ERC20(tokenAddress).safeTransfer(owner, tokenAmount);
        emit Recovered(tokenAddress, tokenAmount);
    }
```

## Tools Used
None
## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Add an additional check
```
        require(
            tokenAddress != address(rewardsToken),
            "Cannot withdraw the rewards token"
        );
```
