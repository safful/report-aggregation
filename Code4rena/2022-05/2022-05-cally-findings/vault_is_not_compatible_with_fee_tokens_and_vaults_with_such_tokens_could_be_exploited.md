# Vulnerability details

## Impact

Some ERC20 tokens charge a transaction fee for every transfer (used to encourage staking, add to liquidity pool, pay a fee to contract owner, etc.). If any such token is used in the `createVault()` function, either the token cannot be withdrawn from the contract (due to insufficient token balance), or it could be exploited by other such token holders and the `Cally` contract would lose economic value and some users would be unable to withdraw the underlying asset. 


## Proof of Concept

Plenty of ERC20 tokens charge a fee for every transfer (e.g. Safemoon and its forks), in which the amount of token received is less than the amount being sent. When a fee token is used as the `token` in the `createVault()` function, the amount received by the contract would be less than the amount being sent. To be more precise, the increase in the `cally` contract token balance would be less than `vault.tokenIdOrAmount` for such ERC20 token because of the fee. 

```
        vault.tokenType == TokenType.ERC721
            ? ERC721(vault.token).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), vault.tokenIdOrAmount)
            : ERC20(vault.token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), vault.tokenIdOrAmount);
```

The implication is that both the `exercise()` function and the `withdraw()` function are guaranteed to revert if there's no other vault in the contract that contains the same fee tokens, due to insufficient token balance in the `Cally` contract. 

When an attacker observes that a vault is being created that contains such fee tokens, the attacker could create a new vault himself that contains the same token, and then withdraw the same amount. Essentially the `Cally` contract would be paying the transfer fee for the attacker because of how the token amount is recorded. This causes loss of user fund and loss of value from the `Cally` contract. It would make economic sense for the attacker when the fee charged by the token accrue to the attacker. The attacker would essentially use the `Cally` contract as a conduit to generate fee income. 


## Tools Used

Manual review

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

Recommend disallowing fee tokens from being used in the vault. This can be done by adding a `require()` statement to check that the amount increase of the `token` balance in the `Cally` contract is equal to the amount being sent by the caller of the `createVault()` function.
