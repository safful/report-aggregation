# [Malicious owner can arbitrarily change fee to any % valueâ€¨](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-tracer-findings/issues/66)

# Vulnerability details

## Impact

Tracer protocol like any other allows market creators to charge fees for trades. However, a malicious/greedy owner can arbitrarily change fee to any % value and without an event to observe this change or a timelock to react, there is no easy way for users to monitor this via front-end or off-chain monitoring tools.

Impact: Users trade on a market with 0.1% fees. The owner suddenly changes this to 100%. Users realise this only after their trades are executed. Market loses confidence. Protocol takes a reputational hit.

## Proof of Concept

See similar Medium-severity finding in ConsenSys's Audit of 1inch Liquidity Protocol (https://consensys.net/diligence/audits/2020/12/1inch-liquidity-protocol/#unpredictable-behavior-for-users-due-to-admin-front-running-or-general-bad-timing

## Tools Used

Manual Analysis

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

Emit event, provide time lock for users to react and establish an upper threshold for fees that is decided across markets by governance.
