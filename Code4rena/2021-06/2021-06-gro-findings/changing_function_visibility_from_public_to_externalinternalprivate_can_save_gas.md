# [Changing function visibility from public to external/internal/private can save gas](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-gro-findings/issues/37)

# Vulnerability details

## Impact

For public functions, the input parameters are copied to memory automatically which costs gas. If a function is only called externally, making its visibility as external will save gas because external functionâ€™s parameters are not copied into memory and are instead read from calldata directly. If a function is called only from with that contract or derived contracts, making it internal/private can further reduce gas costs because the expensive calls are converted into cheaper jumps.


## Proof of Concept

The only callers of eoaOnly() are external contracts DepositHandler and WithdrawHandler.

validGTokenDecrease() can be made private just like validGTokenIncrease because it is only called from within Controller.
