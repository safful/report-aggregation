# [Removing redundant code can save gas](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-gro-findings/issues/42)

## Impact

In LG setDependencies(), the code to approve withdrawHandler to pull from lifeguard is repeated twice, once to set it to 0 allowance if the withdrawHandler is != 0 and then unconditionally to set it MAX. Given that this is the only function that sets withdrawHandler, the first set of 0 approvals seem to be redundant given the unconditional approvals that follow. Removing this can save some gas although we donâ€™t expect this to be called often.

The redundant logic could be for the case where the withdrawHandler is updated and the old handler is given an approval of 0 and the new one MAX.


## Proof of Concept

## Tools Used

Manual Analysis

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

Evaluate code and remove logic if redundant. If this is present to handle withdrawHandler updates then ignore this recommendation.
