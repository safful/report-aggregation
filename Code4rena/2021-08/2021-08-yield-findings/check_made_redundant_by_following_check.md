# [Check made redundant by following check](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-yield-findings/issues/48)

# Vulnerability details

## Impact
The check for array lengths is unnecessary in two places where the following check on txHash will anyway fail if the lengths donâ€™t match with what was hashed earlier during schedule. Removing the length check can save a little gas.

Such a require() in cancel() can be removed because if there is a mismatch, the entry lookup in transactions[] will fail anyway and also, this will not be sceduled/executed.
