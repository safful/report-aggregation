# Vulnerability details

## Impact

Changing a functionâ€™s visibility from public to external can save gas by avoiding the unnecessary copying of data to memory. Function stakeFromUser() in Staker.sol is only called from SyntheticTokens.sol and not from within the contract itself which means this can be made external.
