# Vulnerability details

# [2022-08-fiatdao] Inconsistent logic of increase unlock time to the expired locks
## Impact
Can not prevent expired locks being extended.

## Proof of Concept
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-fiatdao/blob/main/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol#L493-L523

Call function function `increaseUnlockTime()` with an expired lock (locked[msg.sender].end < block.timestamp)
* Case 1: if sender's lock was not delegated to another address, function will be revert because of the requirement
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-fiatdao/blob/main/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol#L511
* Case 2: if sender's lock was delegated to another address, function will not check anything and the lock can be extended.

But in case 1, senderâ€™s lock was not delegated to another, the sender can delegate to new address with end time of lock equal to new end time. After that he can call `increaseUnlockTime()` and move to case 2. Then sender can undelegate and the lock will be extended, and sender will take back vote power.

Here is the script :
``` typescript=
describe("voting escrow", async () => {
    it("increase unlock time issue", async () => {
      await createSnapshot(provider);
      //alice creates lock
      let lockTime = WEEK + (await getTimestamp());
      await ve.connect(alice).createLock(lockAmount, lockTime);
      // bob creates lock
      lockTime = 50 * WEEK + (await getTimestamp());
      await ve.connect(bob).createLock(10 ** 8, lockTime);
      //pass 1 week, alice's lock is expired
      await ethers.provider.send("evm_mine", [await getTimestamp() + WEEK]);
      expect(await ve.balanceOf(alice.address)).to.eq(0);
      //alice can not increase unlock timme
      await expect(ve.connect(alice).increaseUnlockTime(lockTime)).to.be.revertedWith("Lock expired");
      //alice delegate to bob then can increase unlock time
      await ve.connect(alice).delegate(bob.address);
      await expect(ve.connect(alice).increaseUnlockTime(lockTime)).to.not.be.reverted;
      //alice delegate back herself
      await ve.connect(alice).delegate(alice.address);
      expect(await ve.balanceOf(alice.address)).to.gt(0);
    });
```

## Tools Used
Manual review
## Recommended Mitigation Steps
In every cases, expired locks should able to be extended -> should remove line https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-fiatdao/blob/main/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol#L511
