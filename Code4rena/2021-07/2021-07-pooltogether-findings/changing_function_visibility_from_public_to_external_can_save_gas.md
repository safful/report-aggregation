# [Changing function visibility from public to external can save gas](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-pooltogether-findings/issues/32)

# Vulnerability details

## Impact

Assuming the initialize() function is going to be called from a deployment script, its visibility can be made external. 

For public functions, the input parameters are copied to memory automatically which costs gas. If a function is only called externally, making its visibility as external will save gas because external functionâ€™s parameters are not copied into memory and are instead read from calldata directly.
