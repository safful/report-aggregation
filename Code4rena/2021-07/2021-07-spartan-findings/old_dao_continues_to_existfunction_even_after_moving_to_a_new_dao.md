# [Old DAO continues to exist/function even after moving to a new DAO](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan-findings/issues/107)

# Vulnerability details

## Impact

If moveDAO() is executed after voting, the existing DAO contract continues to function as before whereas it should ideally cease to function/exist from the usersâ€™ perspective or at least function as a clone of the new DAO by using the same addresses as it does.

Scenario: moveDAO is executed to make DAO and BASE.DAO point to the new address. Existing DAO contract continues to function but all the other interfacing contracts (ROUTER, UTILS, DAOVAULT, BONDVAULT, SYNTHVAULT, POOLFACTORY, SYNTHFACTORY and RESERVE) use the updated DAO address as updated in BASE. At a minimum, this leads to undefined behavior and at worst an attack where the old DAOs (there could be many) are exploited because it still points to valid router, pool and vault contracts.

Manual Analysis

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

At a minimum, all DAO public/external functions should check and revert if daoHasMoved or the design can even consider a selfdestruct to destroy the DAO contract once it has successfully handed over to the new DAO contract and all pending actions have been cleared. In the unlikely requirement of older DAO contracts continuing to exist, they should at least use addresses of interfacing contracts as reported by the new DAO which could have updated them.
