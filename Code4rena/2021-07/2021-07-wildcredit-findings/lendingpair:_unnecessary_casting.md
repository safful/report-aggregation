# Vulnerability details

## Impact

The address casting of `_token` in `lpToken[address(_token)]` can be removed in the `withdrawAll()`, `_withdraw()` and `_borrow()` functions, since `_token` is already an address in these functions. 

In other words, `lpToken[address(_token)]` *â†’* `lpToken[token]`
