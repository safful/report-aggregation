# [`safeTransferMany()` doesn't actually use safe transfer](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/356)

# Vulnerability details

Both `BondNFT` and `GovNFT` are an ERC721 implementation, they both also have a function named `safeTransferMany()` which its name implies is supposed to safe transfer many tokens at once.
However the function doesn't actually safe transfer (doesn't )

## Impact
Users might use this function, expecting it to verify that the receiver is an `ERC721Receiver`, but will get their funds stuck in a contract that doesn't support ERC721.

## Proof of Concept
I've added the following tests to the `GovNFT` tests.
1st test will succeed (tx will revert) since `safeTransferFrom()` does actually use safe transfer.
2nd will fail (tx won't revert), since `safeTransferMany()` doesn't actually use a safe transfer.

```

Output (I've shortened the output. following test will also fail, since the successful transfer will affect them):

```
      âœ” Safe transfer to contract
      1) Safe transfer many to contract

```


## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Call `_safeTransfer()` instead of `_transfer()`.
