# [Funds in the pool could be stolen by exploiting `flashSwap` in `HybridPool`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-sushitrident-findings/issues/167)

# Vulnerability details

## Impact

An attacker can call the `bento.harvest` function during the callback function of a flash swap of the `HybridPool` to reduce the number of input tokens that he has to pay to the pool, as long as there is any unrealized profit in the strategy contract of the underlying asset.

## Proof of Concept

1. The `HybridPool` accounts for the reserve and balance of the pool using the `bento.toAmount` function, which represents the actual amount of assets that the pool owns instead of the relative share. The value of `toAmount` could increase or decrease if the `bento.harvest` function is called (by anyone), depending on whether the strategy contract earns or loses money.
2. Supposing that the DAI strategy contract of `Bento` has a profit not accounted for yet. To account for the profit, anyone could call `harvest` on `Bento` with the corresponding parameters, which, as a result, increases the `elastic` of the DAI token.
3. Now, an attacker wants to utilize the unrealized profit to steal funds from a DAI-WETH hybrid pool. He calls `flashSwap` to initiate a flash swap from WETH to DAI. First, the pool transfers the corresponding amount of DAI to him, calls the `tridentSwapCallback` function on the attacker's contract, and expects that enough DAI is received at the end.
4. During the `tridentSwapCallback` function, the attacker calls `bento.harvest` to realize the profit of DAI. As a result, the pool's `bento.toAmount` increases, and the amount of DAI that the attacker has to pay to the pool is decreased. The attacker could get the same amount of ETH but paying less DAI by exploiting this bug.

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider not using `bento.toAmount` to track the reservers and balances, but use `balanceOf` instead (as done in the other two pools).
