# [.length in a loop](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-union-findings/issues/92)

# Vulnerability details

## Impact
.length in a loop can be extracted into a variable and used where necessary to reduce the number of storage reads. An example where this could be applied:
  for (uint256 i = 0; i < moneyMarkets.length; i++)
Solution:
  uint moneyMarketsLength = moneyMarkets.length;
  for (uint256 i = 0; i < moneyMarketsLength; i++)
Cache the length of the array and use this local variable when iterating over the storage array.
